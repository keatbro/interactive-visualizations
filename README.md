# interactive-visualizations

Although the webpage looks like it was built the year I was born, the actual visualizations and interactivity in the webpage are solid.

This is a JavaScript program that analyzes data from a bacterial bellybutton study (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/).

A user selects an individual for which to analyze, and the webpage creates charts and metadata specific to that individual.

Among many things, this project made me learn I need to wash my bellybutton more often.
